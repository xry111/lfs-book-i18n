"One important reason for this project's existence is to help you learn how a "
"Linux system works from the inside out. Building an LFS system helps "
"demonstrate what makes Linux tick, and how things work together and depend "
"on each other. One of the best things that this learning experience can "
"provide is the ability to customize a Linux system to suit your own unique "
"needs."
msgstr ""
"本项目存在的一项重要原因就是，它能够帮助您学习 Linux 系统的内部是如何运作的。"
"构建 LFS 系统的过程将展示 Linux 系统的工作原理，以及其各组成部分的协作和依赖"
"关系。最棒的是，有了这些经验，您将能够定制 Linux 系统，使其满足您独一无二的需"
"求。"

"Another key benefit of LFS is that it allows you to have more control over "
"the system without relying on someone else's Linux implementation. With LFS, "
"you are in the driver's seat and dictate every aspect of the system."
msgstr ""
"LFS 的另一个关键优势是，它允许您更好地控制您的系统，而不用依赖于其他人的 "
"Linux 实现。您就像坐在驾驶座上一样，完全掌控系统的各个方面。"

"LFS allows you to create very compact Linux systems. When installing regular "
"distributions, you are often forced to install a great many programs which "
"are probably never used or understood. These programs waste resources. You "
"may argue that with today's hard drive and CPUs, such resources are no "
"longer a consideration. Sometimes, however, you are still constrained by "
"size considerations if nothing else. Think about bootable CDs, USB sticks, "
"and embedded systems. Those are areas where LFS can be beneficial."
msgstr ""
"LFS 允许您创建非常紧凑的 Linux 系统。在安装传统的 Linux 发行版时，您往往不得"
"不安装一大堆可能永远不会用到，甚至完全无法理解其必要性的程序。它们会浪费系统"
"资源。您可能以为，有了现代的大容量硬盘和高速 CPU，就不需要考虑资源耗费的问"
"题。然而，在一些情况下，即使不考虑其他问题，仅仅存储空间的约束就十分紧张。可"
"引导 CD，USB 启动盘或者嵌入式系统就是典型代表。在这些领域中，LFS 是十分有用"
"的。"

"Another advantage of a custom built Linux system is security. By compiling "
"the entire system from source code, you are empowered to audit everything "
"and apply all the security patches desired. It is no longer necessary to "
"wait for somebody else to compile binary packages that fix a security hole.  "
"Unless you examine the patch and implement it yourself, you have no "
"guarantee that the new binary package was built correctly and adequately "
"fixes the problem."

"自行定制的 Linux 系统在安全方面也具有优势。在从源码编译整个系统的过程中，您有"
"机会审核所有的代码，并安装您需要的安全补丁。您不需要像往常那样等待其他人编译"
"一个修复了安全漏洞的二进制包。另外，除非您亲自检查并应用了补丁，您无法保证新"
"的二进制包在编译过程中没有出问题，并且正确修补了安全漏洞。"

"There are too many other good reasons to build your own LFS system to list "
"them all here. In the end, education is by far the most powerful of reasons. "
"As you continue in your LFS experience, you will discover the power that "
"information and knowledge truly bring."

"此外，构建 LFS 系统还有很多好处，这里就不一一列举了。在所有原因中，最重要的"
"是，在您编译和使用 LFS 的实践中，您将了解很多威力巨大的信息和知识。"
