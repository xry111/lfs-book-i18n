"Package Management is an often requested addition to the LFS Book. A Package "
"Manager allows tracking the installation of files making it easy to remove "
"and upgrade packages. As well as the binary and library files, a package "
"manager will handle the installation of configuration files.  Before you "
"begin to wonder, NO&mdash;this section will not talk about nor recommend any "
"particular package manager. What it provides is a roundup of the more "
"popular techniques and how they work. The perfect package manager for you "
"may be among these techniques or may be a combination of two or more of "
"these techniques. This section briefly mentions issues that may arise when "
"upgrading packages."
