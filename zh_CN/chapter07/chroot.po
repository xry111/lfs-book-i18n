"The <parameter>-i</parameter> option given to the <command>env</command> "
"command will clear all variables of the chroot environment. After that, only "
"the <envar>HOME</envar>, <envar>TERM</envar>, <envar>PS1</envar>, and "
"<envar>PATH</envar> variables are set again. The "
"<parameter>TERM=$TERM</parameter> construct will set the <envar>TERM</envar> "
"variable inside chroot to the same value as outside chroot. This variable is "
"needed for programs like <command>vim</command> and <command>less</command> "
"to operate properly.  If other variables are desired, such as "
"<envar>CFLAGS</envar> or <envar>CXXFLAGS</envar>, this is a good place to "
"set them again."
