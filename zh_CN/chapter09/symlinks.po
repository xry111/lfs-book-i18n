"Udev, by default, names network devices according to Firmware/BIOS data or "
"physical characteristics like the bus, slot, or MAC address.  The purpose of "
"this naming convention is to ensure that network devices are named "
"consistently and not based on the time the network card was discovered.  For "
"example, on a computer having two network cards made by Intel and Realtek, "
"the network card manufactured by Intel may become eth0 and the Realtek card "
"becomes eth1. In some cases, after a reboot the cards could get renumbered "
"the other way around."
