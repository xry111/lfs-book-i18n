"Linux systems in general traditionally used a static device creation method, "
"whereby a great many device nodes were created under <filename "
"class=\"directory\">/dev</filename> (sometimes literally thousands of "
"nodes), regardless of whether the corresponding hardware devices actually "
"existed. This was typically done via a <command>MAKEDEV</command> script, "
"which contains a number of calls to the <command>mknod</command> program "
"with the relevant major and minor device numbers for every possible device "

"In February 2000, a new filesystem called <systemitem "

"The main problem with the approach adopted by <systemitem "
"class=\"filesystem\">devfs</systemitem> was the way it handled device "
"detection, creation, and naming. The latter issue, that of device node "
"naming, was perhaps the most critical. It is generally accepted that if "
"device names are allowed to be configurable, then the device naming policy "
"should be up to a system administrator, not imposed on them by any "
"particular developer(s). The <systemitem "
"class=\"filesystem\">devfs</systemitem> file system also suffered from race "
"conditions that were inherent in its design and could not be fixed without a "
"substantial revision to the kernel. It was marked as deprecated for a long "
"period &ndash; due to a lack of maintenance &ndash; and was finally removed "
"from the kernel in June, 2006."

"Device drivers compiled as modules may have aliases built into them.  "
