"The overall goal of this chapter and <xref "

"system.  By using <command>chroot</command>, the commands in the remaining "
"chapters will be contained within that environment, ensuring a clean, "
"trouble-free build of the target LFS system. The build process has been "

"The build process is based on the process of "
"<emphasis>cross-compilation</emphasis>. Cross-compilation is normally used "
"for building a compiler and its toolchain for a machine different from the "
"one that is used for the build. This is not strictly needed for LFS, since "
"the machine where the new system will run is the same as the one used for "
"the build. But cross-compilation has the great advantage that anything that "
"is cross-compiled cannot depend on the host environment."
