"Most packages provide a test suite. Running the test suite for a newly built "
"package is a good idea because it can provide a <quote>sanity check</quote> "
"indicating that everything compiled correctly. A test suite that passes its "
"set of checks usually proves that the package is functioning as the "
"developer intended. It does not, however, guarantee that the package is "
"totally bug free."

"Some test suites are more important than others. For example, the test "
"suites for the core toolchain packages&mdash;GCC, binutils, and "
"glibc&mdash;are of the utmost importance due to their central role in a "
"properly functioning system. The test suites for GCC and glibc can take a "
"very long time to complete, especially on slower hardware, but are strongly "
"recommended."

"Running the test suites in <xref linkend=\"chapter-cross-tools\"/> and <xref "
"linkend=\"chapter-temporary-tools\"/> is impossible, since the programs are "
"compiled with a cross-compiler, so are not supposed to be able to run on the "

"A common issue with running the test suites for binutils and GCC is running "
"out of pseudo terminals (PTYs). This can result in a high number of failing "
"tests. This may happen for several reasons, but the most likely cause is "
"that the host system does not have the <systemitem "
"class=\"filesystem\">devpts</systemitem> file system set up correctly. This "
"issue is discussed in greater detail at <ulink "
"url=\"&lfs-root;lfs/faq.html#no-ptys\"/>."

"Sometimes package test suites will fail, but for reasons which the "
