"In this chapter, we will perform a few additional tasks to prepare for "
"building the temporary system. We will create a set of directories in "
"<filename class=\"directory\">$LFS</filename> for the installation of the "
"temporary tools, add an unprivileged user to reduce risk, and create an "
"appropriate build environment for that user. We will also explain the unit "
"of time we use to measure how long LFS packages take to build, or "
